Description: This program looks at Reddit RSS feed files, and downloads an
    offline copy of all images an videos (whatever it can) so that the images
    can be viewed offline. This is meant to reduce the number of times the user
    needs to open a browser while looking at their RSS feed reader.

    # CODE HERE
    """
    1. Get Reddit feed from URL
    2. Look for base URLs (ex: "https://i.redd.it/")
    3. Download image
    4. Replace entire found URL in new file
    5. Save entire new file as .xml in a file path

    Notes:
    - Step 4 is not with step 2 because the program may not be able to get the
    media.
